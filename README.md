The following project contains a program which:
1. reads in a numerical infix expression from the user and converts it to a postfix expression.
2. Once converted, the program will then solve the postfix expression and print the result for the user.
3. Mainly uses stack data structure to achieve this.

This project is meant to demonstrate good fundamental understanding of an example of data structures and algorithms
